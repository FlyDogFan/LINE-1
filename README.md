# DCCA: Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis

This is an implementation of LINE (Large-scale information network embedding) in Python. It needs Theano and Keras libraries to get executed.
LINE is a node embedding algorithm for networks. It is originally proposed in the following paper:

Tang, Jian, Meng Qu, Mingzhe Wang, Ming Zhang, Jun Yan, and Qiaozhu Mei. "[Line: Large-scale information network embedding.](http://www.www2015.it/documents/proceedings/proceedings/p1067.pdf)" In Proceedings of the 24th International Conference on World Wide Web, 2015.
Galen Andrew, Raman Arora, Jeff Bilmes, Karen Livescu, "[Deep Canonical Correlation Analysis.](http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/andrew13.pdf)" ICML. 2013.

You may find the original implementation of LINE in C++ on [Github](https://github.com/tangjianpku/LINE).
